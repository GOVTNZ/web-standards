**Impact of failure:** Failing these requirements means people can’t easily contact the government organisation responsible for the website.

**Related Web Usability Standard requirements:** [2.2 Contact information](https://webtoolkit.govt.nz/standards/web-usability-standard/#contact).

<div class="details" markdown="1">

#### What are the contact information requirements?

The website must link to a web page (“Contact Us Page”) that provides contact information for obtaining help related to the Website or for contacting the New Zealand Government organisation responsible for the website.

An unambiguous link to the Contact Us Page must be visible on the website’s home page.

The Contact Us Page must clearly indicate that it provides contact information for the website (e.g. “For enquiries related to ministry.govt.nz or the Ministry…”), and include the following information:

* an email address that is regularly monitored by the organisation responsible for the website

* a call centre phone number for each service the website provides, and

* a postal address that is regularly monitored.

To enable even more points of contact with the organisation responsible for the website, the Contact Us Page should, but need not, also include a telephone number, and a physical address if the organisation has a physical location that is open to the public. And to support people who are deaf, hearing-impaired, deaf-blind, or speech-impaired, it is recommended that a link to the New Zealand Relay Service (NZ Relay) be included.

#### How to test

1. Check that a visible link to a "Contact Us Page" is present on the home page, and that it is clear from the link’s text that its target is the Contact Us Page for the Website. If there is such a link, skip to step 3.

2. Review the website. Check that the website includes a link to a web page that provides contact information for obtaining help related to the site or for contacting the NZ Government organisation responsible for it. Note: This check may require some familiarity with the Website. If the site doesn't link to such a page, record a failure and move on to the next test.

3. Check that it is clear, from the content of the Contact Us Page, that the contact information on that page relates to the website. Otherwise, record a failure.

4. Check that the Contact Us Page includes, and otherwise record a failure.:

	 * the address of an email account that is regularly monitored by the Website’s responsible organisation;

	 * the telephone number for each call centre that supports a service provided by the Website; and,

	 * a regularly monitored postal address. 

5. **_[Optional]_** Check that the Contact Us Page includes:

	 * the number of a monitored telephone line;

	 * a physical street address, if applicable; and,

	 * a link to the New Zealand Relay Service (NZ Relay) for people who are deaf, hearing-impaired, deaf-blind, or speech-impaired.
