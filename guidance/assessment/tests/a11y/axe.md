You should run the aXe tool on each page you test. You should also run it for each viewport because different responsive designs may present different accessibility errors.

1. Run the aXe extension in Chrome by opening the developer tools.

2. Along the top line of the developer tools pane, you should be able to select aXe, if you have it installed. (You may have to hit the 》toggle on the right of the toolbar to reveal the 'aXe' option.)

3. Hit the 'Analyze' button. 

4. In the aXe summary pane (where the issues are summarised), change the drop-down option from 'show:all' to 'show: violations'.

5. Review the violations, noting and recording the individual failures and their causes.

6. Remember to resize your browser window and test at the other viewport sizes. If there is no change to page content or layout, record ‘no change’ and don’t test for that viewport.
