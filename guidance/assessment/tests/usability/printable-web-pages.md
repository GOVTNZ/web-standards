**Consequence of failure:** Failing these requirements means people who print web pages might find them difficult to read or illegible.

#### What are the requirements for printable web pages?

Each web page's main content must be printable on standard sheets of paper. 

It is recommended, but not required, that the printed content leave out the following items: 

* primary content navigation

* secondary content navigation

* thematic or decorative banner

* breadcrumbs

* search form. 

It is also recommended, but not required, that text content print by default as black text on a white background. For a number of reasons, the legibility of coloured text can degrade when printed.

#### How to test

1. Use the browser's print preview functionality, or actually print the page.

2. Check that the web page's core information fits on 1 or more standard sheets of A4 paper, in either portrait or landscape. If it doesn't, record a failure, note the cause in the comments field and move to the next test.

3. **_[Optional]_** See if the printed version of the web page leaves out the following items:

	* primary content navigation

	* secondary content navigation

	* thematic or decorative banner

	* breadcrumbs

	* search form.

	If these are on the printed copy of the page, record a failure, note the cause in the comments field and move to the next test.

4. **_[Optional]_** Try to print the page in colour, using the printer's settings. If the page's text content does not print out in black and white by default, record a failure, and note the cause in the comments field.
