#### What are the general copyright statement requirements?

The website must link to a general copyright statement ("General Copyright Statement").

An unambiguous link to the General Copyright Statement must be visible on the website's home page.

The General Copyright Statement must:

* clearly indicate that it applies to the website (e.g. "Copyright material on ministry.govt.nz nz is protected by copyright owned by the Ministry on behalf of the Crown.")

* state that copyright material on the website is protected by copyright, and

* set out the licensing terms under which the website's material can be re-used by others.

To clarify which content the general licensing terms apply to, the General Copyright Statement should state that the general licensing terms do not apply to material on the website that is covered by the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981.

If the website contains third party copyright material, the General Copyright Statement must state:

* the source and copyright status of such material so that it's clear which items are subject to third party copyright

* that the website's re-use licence does not apply to material that is subject to third party copyright, and

* that permission to re-use third party copyright material cannot be given by that New Zealand Government organisation.

The website's licensing terms should align with New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework (NZGOAL).

#### How to test

1. Review the home page for a visible link to a General Copyright Statement.  Make sure that the link's text clearly indicates that it's going to the website's General Copyright Statement.  If there's no link, or if the link text isn't clear, record a failure, note the cause in the comments field and move onto the next test.

2. Check that the website includes a link to a web page that includes a General Copyright Statement about the copyright status of the website's content. Note: This link may or may not be present on the website's home page. If the site doesn't link to such a page, record a failure, note the cause in the comments field and move on to the next test.

3. Check that the General Copyright Statement:

	* clearly indicates that it applies to the website (e.g. "Copyright material on ministry.govt.nz nz is protected by copyright owned by the Ministry on behalf of the Crown.")

	* states that copyright material on the website is protected by copyright, and

	* sets out the licensing terms under which the website's material can be re-used by others. 

Otherwise record a failure, note the cause in the comments field, and move onto the next test.

4. Review the website for third party copyright material. If the website has any, check that the General Copyright Statement (or a statement near each item) states:

	* the source and copyright status of such material so that it's clear which items are subject to third party copyright

	* that the website's re-use licence does not apply to material that is subject to third party copyright, and

	* that permission to re-use third party copyright material cannot be given by that New Zealand Government organisation.

5. **_[Optional]_** Check that the General Copyright Statement includes a statement to the effect that its general licensing terms doesn't apply to material on the website that is covered by the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981.

6. **_[Optional]_** Check that the General Copyright Statement applies a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY) licence to copyright material on the website.
