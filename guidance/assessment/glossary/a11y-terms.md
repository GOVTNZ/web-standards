CSS
: Cascading Style Sheets. These are the most common way to describe how HTML elements should look on a page.

focus
: when you use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to move forward through a web page, the browser sets keyboard 'focus' to each interactive component (e.g. links, buttons, text inputs, etc). When something has focus, you're able to interact with it using your keyboard, like pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> on a link. There should also be some kind of visual focus indicator that makes it clear to sighted users which element currently has focus.

high-stakes content
: critical content that people need. Examples include content about:

	* civil emergencies and responses
	
	* entitlement or access to benefits, education, consumer or other community protections, passports, or visas
	
	* rights in criminal and civil proceedings
	
	* central government elections or referenda
	
	* tax obligations and rebates
	
	* general health information, specific health advice, health and safety in employment.

viewport
: the visible part of a web page. If the web page is larger than the viewport, the user can move the viewport around by scrolling vertically or horizontally. Or else the page resizes to fit all the content on a different-sized screen.

visual label
: a label you can see that tells you what to enter in a form field.
