## Introduction

This document is a working draft intended to gather in one place an overview of all the sets of rules, standards, codes and guides that must and should inform NZ Government web work. It is intended to answer the following questions:

* What do I need to do so that I procure, record and deliver quality government information and services online?
* What are the minimum standards and legal requirements around procurement, security, privacy, usability, accessibility, etc. where the online delivery of government information and services is concerned?
* What conventions and common practices (e.g. style guides, name and address conventions, data structures, etc.) do we share across government to make our delivery of government online information and services more consistent and coherent?
